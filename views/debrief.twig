    <p>Thank you for participating in our study. Please read the debriefing information below:</p>

        <h1>Human Automation Teaming and Decision Making</h1>
        <p>In general terms, in our experiments we are looking at how you decide who to receive advice from. We are studying fundamental human cognition and perception with a long-term goal of helping people make better decisions surrounding automation use.</p>
        <p>In this experiment, both your success at the task and the way that you responded were collected, and these will be used to determine performance on different aspects of the task. However, we are not looking at any individualâ€™s performance, but rather try to determine whether differences between groups of people performing under the different conditions can be explained by factors like the type of automated support you received or how you perceived the task and your own performance.</p>
        <p>Note that your data will be identified using an arbitrary subject number. At no time will your name be connected with your data.</p>
        <p>These studies advance both basic science in Psychology, adding to our understanding of human capacities and limitations. They also contribute to the potential future application of Psychology to real-world situations; for example, by providing insight into how to present information or automated assistance to improve decision making.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this research, or would like to discuss the results after the experiment has been completed, please contact Colleen Patton using the following information:</p>
